Abstract
--------

	This directory contains demos that show various ways to
	program with Jacl and Tcl Blend.

Demos
-----

1) simplepkg:   Shows how to write a simple Tcl extension package in
                Java.

2) gluepkg:     Shows how to write Tcl commands that glue together
                existing Java applications.

3) watchpkg:    Shows how to extend Tcl with a Java class by writing
                code in either Tcl or in Java.

4) pyramidpkg:  Shows how to embed a Tcl console inside a Java applet.
 		Note: This demo is only available for Jacl.  In 
		addition to your normal CLASSPATH settings, "." needs
		to be appended to the this environment variable.

5) guiDemo:	Shows how to use the java::* commands to create GUI
		components and handle user events.

Running The Demos using Jacl
----------------------------

a)  Depending on your platform, see the README in ../unix/ or ../win for
    instructions on how to install Jacl.

b)  To compile the demos in UNIX goto the ../unix directory and type
    "make demos".  For binary releases, all of the class files will
    automatically be compiled for all demos. 

c)  Run the Jacl shell.  See the README in ../unix or ../win for 
    instructions on how to do this.

d)  See the README in each of the demos directory for specific information 
    on how each demo works.


Running The Demos using Tcl Blend
---------------------------------

a)  Depending on your platform, see the README in ../unix/ or ../win for
    instructions on how to install Tcl Blend.

b)  To compile the demos in UNIX goto the ../unix directory and type
    "make demos".  For binary releases, all of the class files will
    automatically be compiled for all demos. 

c)  Run tclsh, and load the Tcl Blend library.  See the README in ../unix or
    ../win for instructions on how to do this.

d)  See the README in each of the demos directory for specific information
