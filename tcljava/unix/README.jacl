Jacl

This is the directory where you configure, compile, test, and install 
UNIX versions of Jacl.

The rest of this file contains instructions on how to do this.  The 
release should compile and run either "out of the box" or with trivial 
changes on any UNIX-like system that approximates POSIX, BSD, or 
System V.  We know that it runs on workstations from Sun.  To compile 
for a PC running Windows, see the README file in the directory ../win.


How To Install Jacl (Binary Release Only):
------------------------------------------

(a) In the top-level directory there are two jar files, jacl.jar
    and tclblend.jar	

    Set your CLASSPATH environment variable to include jacl.jar and
    tclblend.jar 

    For example, if the Jacl distribution was at /usr/local/jacl1.1b1,
    and you had not set CLASSPATH previously:

    setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/jacl1.1b1/jacl.jar:/usr/local/jacl1.1b1/tclblend.jar

(b) At this point you can play with Jacl by typing "java tcl.lang.Shell".  
    If you haven't set the CLASSPATH variable correctly, you will see a 
    java error "Can't find class tcl.lang.Shell.


How To Compile And Install Jacl (Source Release Only):
------------------------------------------------------

(a) Check for patches as described in ../README.

(b) Create a Makefile by typing "./configure".

(c) Type "make".  This will create a directory called jacl that will
    contain all of the Java class files needed to use Jacl.

(d) If the make fails then you'll have to personalize the Makefile
    for your site or possibly modify the distribution in other ways.
    If you need to modify Makefile, there are comments at the beginning 
    of it that describe the things you might want to change and how to 
    change them.

(e) Set your CLASSPATH environment variable to include jacl.jar and
    tclblend.jar 

    For example, if the Jacl distribution was at /usr/local/jacl1.1b1,
    and you had not set CLASSPATH previously:

    setenv CLASSPATH /usr/local/jacl1.1b1/jacl.jar:/usr/local/jacl1.1b1/tclblend.jar

(f) At this point you can play with Jacl by typing "java tcl.lang.Shell".  
    If you haven't set the CLASSPATH variable correctly, you will see a 
    java error "Can't find class tcl.lang.Shell.

Test suite:
-----------

There is a relatively complete test suite for all of the Tcl core in the 
subdirectory "tests".  To use it just type "make test" in this directory.  
You should then see a printout of the test files processed.  If any errors 
occur, you'll see a much more substantial printout for each error.  See the 
README file in the "tests" directory for more information on the test suite.  
Note: don't run the tests as superuser: this will cause several of them to 
fail.
