Tcl Bean

This is the directory where you configure, compile, and install 
the Tcl Bean for Java Studio.

The rest of this file contains instructions on how to do this.  The 
release should compile and run either "out of the box" or with trivial 
changes on WindowsNT, Windows95 and most flavors of UNIX.

How To Install The Tcl Bean (Binary Release Only):
-------------------------------------------------

(a) Locate the "JS10" directory created when Java Studio was
    installed.   For the rest of this example, this is assumed to be
    "C:\JS10", but may be different on your machine.

(b) Make a directory called C:\JS10\PlugIns\classes

(c) Copy the tclblend.jar file to the C:\JS10\PlugIns\classes directory.

(d) The contents of tclblend.jar must be extracted from the jar file.
    To do this type "cd C:\JS10\PlugIns\classes" then "jar xf tclblend.jar".

(e) Start Java Studio and import the "tclbean.jar" file using the
    standard Java Studio import wizard.  If an error occurs, check
    the C:\JS10\VJ\VJLog file for details on how to fix the problem.


How To Compile And Install The Tcl Bean (Source Release Only):
-------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Build Tcl Blend according to the supplied instructions.

(b) You must have the JavaStudio class files installed on your
    machine. These class files are usually installed when you run the
    JavaStudio installer program. I am not sure where the exact
    location is, but on my machine they are at

	c:\JavaStudio1.0\JS\classes.zip

    If the class files are installed differently on your machine, edit
    the line STUDIO_LIB_DIR in the win\makefile.vc file.

(c) In the win sub directory, type "nmake -f makefile.vc bean".  This
    will create two jar files; tclbean.jar and tclblend.jar.

(d) Locate the "JS10" directory created when Java Studio was
    installed.   For the rest of this example, this is assumed to be
    "C:\JS10", but may be different on your machine.

(e) Make a directory called C:\JS10\PlugIns\classes

(f) Copy the tclblend.jar file to the C:\JS10\PlugIns\classes directory.

(g) The contents of tclblend.jar must be extracted from the jar file.
    To do this type "cd C:\JS10\PlugIns\classes" then "jar xf tclblend.jar".

(h) Start Java Studio and import the "tclbean.jar" file using the
    standard Java Studio import wizard.  If an error occurs, check
    the C:\JS10\VJ\VJLog file for details on how to fix the problem.

INSTALLATION FOR UNIX
======================================================================

How To Install The Tcl Bean (Binary Release Only):
-------------------------------------------------

(a) Locate the "~/.js1.0" directory created in your home directory.  If
    Java Studio has never been run in your environment, the "~/.js1.0"
    directory will not exist.  Either run Java Studio once or create this
    directory yourself.  For the rest of this example, the install
    directory is assumed to be "~/.js1.0", but may be different on
    your machine. 

(b) Make a directory called ~/.js1.0/PlugIns/classes

(c) Copy the tclblend.jar file to the ~/.js1.0/PlugIns/classes directory.

(d) The contents of tclblend.jar must be extracted from the jar file.  To
    do this type "cd ~/.js1.0/PlugIns/classes" then "jar xf tclblend.jar".

(e) Start Java Studio and import the "tclbean.jar" file using the
    standard Java Studio import wizard.  If an error occurs, check
    the ~/.js1.0/vj/VJLog file for details on how to fix the problem.


How To Compile And Install The Tcl Bean (Source Release Only):
-------------------------------------------------------------

(a) Build Tcl Blend according to the supplied instructions.

(b) In the unix sub directory, type "make bean".  This will create two
    jar files; tclbean.jar and tclblend.jar.

(c) Locate the "~/.js1.0" directory created in your home directory.  If
    Java Studio has never been run in your environment, the "~/.js1.0"
    directory will not exist.  Either run Java Studio once or create this
    directory yourself.  For the rest of this example, the install
    directory is assumed to be "~/.js1.0", but may be different on

(f) The contents of tclblend.jar must be extracted from the jar file.  To
    do this type "cd ~/.js1.0/PlugIns/classes" then "jar xf tclblend.jar".

(g) Start Java Studio and import the "tclbean.jar" file using the
    standard Java Studio import wizard.  If an error occurs, check
    the ~/.js1.0/vj/VJLog file for details on how to fix the problem.
