diffs.txt --  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TCL and JACL

RCS: @(#) $Id: diffs.txt,v 1.1 1998/10/14 21:09:07 cvsadmin Exp $

This file contains a list of differences between Tcl 8.x and Jacl 1.0.

What Works

These features work as do those in Tcl. Please notify us if you find
any behavior that deviates from that of native Tcl.

- All Tcl control flow constructs are fully implemented:

	break, bgerror, case, catch, continue, exit,
	for, foreach, if, proc, return, while
	switch:	-regexp option only works in binary release

- General Tcl commands that are completely implemented in Jacl.

	after, append, auto_load, cd, concat, eval, expr, format,
	global, incr, join, lappend, lindex, linsert list, llength,
	lrange, lreplace, lsort, package, pwd, rename, scan, seek,
	set, source, split, string, subst, tell, time, trace, unknown,
	unset, update, uplevel, upvar, vwait
	
	lsearch: -regexp option only works in binary release
	regexp:	 only works in binary release
	regsub:	 only works in binary release

----------

What Partially Works

These commands are close to being complete.  Please notify us if you
find errors other than those we have described.

- Currently, all I/O commands only handle synchronous I/O.  The
  following IO commands work but are limited to what Java allows. 

	close, eof, file, flush, gets, open, puts
	read, seek, tell, write
	glob:	-buggy on windows

- Regular experessions are only handled in Jacl's binary release.  Tcl
  commands regexp and regsub and lsearch and switch with -regexp flag
  are only fully functional in the binary release of Jacl.  We expect
  there will be different behavior in Jacl's handling of regexps.  The
  package we have included was designed to be compatible with perl5.
  One difference we know of is that the '^' character means "a new
  line begins with" in perl5, but in native Tcl, the '^' denotes
  "strictly begins with".  For those who want to include the regexp
  package in the Jacl source release, the download page is

- Environment variable array "env" doesn't have the same indices
  defined in Jacl as in native Tcl.  USER and HOME are the only
  indices that are defined in both implementations.  Jacl defines
  non-native indices, such as CLASSPATH.

- Tcl commands that are not fully functional

	info:	Missing "loaded" option
	exec:	Only works on unix, but pipes and redirections don't work

----------

What Does Not Work

- Tcl commands that are not yet implemented in Jacl

	auto_execok, auto_mkindex, auto_reset
	binary, clock, fblocked, fcopy, fconfigure, fileevent
	history, interp, load, namespace, pkg_mkIndex, pid
	socket
