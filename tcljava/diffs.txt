diffs.txt --  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TCL and JACL

RCS: @(#) $Id: diffs.txt,v 1.3 1999/05/08 23:29:36 dejong Exp $

This file contains a list of differences between Tcl 8.x and Jacl 1.x.

What Works

These features work as do those in Tcl. Please notify us if you find
any behavior that deviates from that of native Tcl.

- All Tcl control flow constructs are fully implemented:

	break, bgerror, case, catch, continue, exit,
	for, foreach, if, proc, return, switch, while

- General Tcl commands that are completely implemented in Jacl.

	after, append, auto_load, cd, clock, concat, eval, expr, format,
	global, incr, join, lappend, lindex, linsert list, llength,
	lrange, lreplace, lsearch, lsort, package, pwd, regexp, regsub,
        rename, scan, seek, set, source, split, string, subst, tell,
        time, trace, unknown, unset, update, uplevel, upvar, vwait

----------

What Partially Works

These commands are close to being complete.  Please notify us if you
find errors other than those we have described.

- Currently, the I/O commands handle only synchronous I/O.  The
  following IO commands work but are limited to what Java allows. 

	close, eof, file, flush, gets, open, puts
	read, seek, tell, write, glob

- Regular experessions work most of the time but we expect there
  will be different behavior in Jacl's handling of regexps.  The
  package we have included was designed to be compatible with perl5.
  One difference we know of is that the '^' character means "a new
  line begins with" in perl5, but in native Tcl, the '^' denotes
  "strictly begins with".

- Environment variable array "env" doesn't have the same indices
  defined in Jacl as in native Tcl.  USER and HOME are the only
  indices that are defined in both implementations.  Jacl defines
  non-native indices, such as CLASSPATH.

- The auto_execok command works on UNIX systems but it does not
  work on Windows systems. This command is used by the unknown
  command to check to see if a given program can be exec'ed. The
  auto_reset command also works on UNIX systems but has no effect
  on Windows systems as it is closely related to auto_execok.

- Tcl commands that are not fully functional

	info:	Missing "loaded" option
	exec:   Not implemented on the Mac, pipes and redirections
                don't work on unix or windows systems

----------

What Does Not Work

- Tcl commands that are not yet implemented in Jacl

	auto_mkindex, binary, fblocked, fcopy, fconfigure, fileevent
	history, interp, load, namespace, pkg_mkIndex, pid
	socket
